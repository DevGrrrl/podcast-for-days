XFM (back when women we're allowed to listen). Adam & Joe. A time when a podcast was a radio show with all the fun and laughter left in and all the annoying music/commercials cut out. If you want to laugh like a maniac when riding the bus or walking down the street alone, there are no subsitutes. Start with the early stuff on Soundcloud before making your way through the BBC 6 Music podcasts on iTunes. Then, should you feel moved to do so, shout "Stephen!" at the top of your lungs in a crowded place. </p>

                    The podcasting world can be divided into pre and post Serial. With this weekly (serial) true crime mystery, we undoubtedly reached PEAK PODCAST. Even my mother listened, and she doens't even understand what a podcast is. Sidebar: I prefered "spin-off" <a href="https://stownpodcast.org/" target="_blank"><em>S-Town</em></a> to Serial's second season, and higly recommend it (the less you know going in, the better).

The Cecil Hotel provided the inpsiration for <em>American Horror Story: Hotel</em>, and I listened this podcast hoping to be suitably spooked on Halloween. What I got was so much more. Wil Wheaton's voice is the perfect vessel for what is, ultimately, a heart-breaking tale.  </p>
